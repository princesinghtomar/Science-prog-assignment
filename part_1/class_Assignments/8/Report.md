After sufficient time and no external interference most of the time population of both prey and predator becomes const. If over exploitation is done then popullation of both predator and prey decreased pray population decreased because of high hunting and predators decreased because of less food available.If Ratio of preoduction and exploition is right then both's popullation line becomes parallel to each other in the end.
